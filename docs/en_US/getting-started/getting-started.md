# Getting Started

In this section, we will walk you through the steps required to efficiently set up the environment for the EMQX Operator, install the Operator, and then use it to deploy EMQX. By following the guidelines outlined in this section, you will be able to effectively install and manage EMQX using the EMQX Operator.

## Prepare the Environment

Before deploying EMQX Operator, please confirm that the following components have been ready:

- A running [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/), for a version of Kubernetes, please check [How to selector Kubernetes version](../index.md#how-to-selector-kubernetes-version)

- A [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) tool that can access the Kubernetes cluster. You can check the status of the Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl cluster-info` command.

- [Helm](https://helm.sh) 3 or higher

## Install EMQX Operator

1. Install and start `cert-manager`.

   ::: tip
   `cert-manager` version `1.1.6` or higher is required. Skip this step if the `cert-manager` is already installed and started.
   :::

   You can use Helm to install `cert-manager`.

   ```bash
   $ helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
     --namespace cert-manager \
     --create-namespace \
     --set installCRDs=true
   ```

   Or you can follow the [cert-manager installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) to install it.

2. Install the EMQX Operator with the command below:

   ```bash
   $ helm repo add emqx https://repos.emqx.io/charts
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm upgrade --install emqx-operator emqx/emqx-operator \
     --namespace emqx-operator-system \
     --create-namespace
   ```

3. Wait till EMQX Operator is ready:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pods -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n emqx-operator-system

   pod/emqx-operator-controller-manager-57bd7b8bd4-h2mcr condition met
   ```

Now that you have successfully installed the operator, you are ready to proceed to the next step. In the [Deploy EMQX](#deploy-emqx) section, you will learn how to use the EMQX Operator to deploy EMQX.

Alternatively, if you are interested in learning how to upgrade or uninstall EMQX using the operator, you can continue reading this section.

## Deploy EMQX

:::: tabs type:card

::: tab EMQX Enterprise 5

1. Save the following content as a YAML file and deploy it with the `kubectl apply`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v2beta1
   kind: EMQX
   metadata:
      name: emqx-ee
   spec:
      image: emqx/emqx-enterprise:5.1.0
   ```

   For more details about the EMQX CRD, please check the [reference document](../reference/v2beta1-reference.md).

2. Wait the EMQX cluster is running.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get emqx

   NAME      IMAGE                        STATUS    AGE
   emqx-ee   emqx/emqx-enterprise:5.1.0   Running   2m55s
   ```

   Make sure the `STATUS` is `Running`, it maybe takes some time to wait for the EMQX cluster to be ready.

   spec:
      image: emqx:5.1
   ```

   For more details about the EMQX CRD, please check the [reference document](../reference/v2beta1-reference.md).

2. Wait the EMQX cluster is running.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get emqx

   NAME   IMAGE      STATUS    AGE
   emqx   emqx:5.1   Running   2m55s
   ```

   Make sure the `STATUS` is `Running`, it maybe takes some time to wait for the EMQX cluster to be ready.
