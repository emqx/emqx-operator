## EMQX cluster TLS certificate configuration

- Create Secret based on TLS certificate

Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive information such as passwords, tokens or keys. For its documentation, please refer to: [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). In this article, we use Secret to save TLS certificate information, so we need to create Secret based on TLS certificate before creating EMQX cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
   name: emqx-tls
type: kubernetes.io/tls
stringData:
   ca.crt: |
     -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
     ...
     -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   tls.crt: |
     -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
     ...
     -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   tls.key: |
     -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
     ...
     -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

> `ca.crt` represents the content of the CA certificate, `tls.crt` represents the content of the server certificate, and `tls.key` represents the content of the serverâ€™s private key. In this example, the contents of the above three fields are omitted, please fill them with the contents of your own certificate.

Save the above file as: secret-tls.yaml, and execute the following command to create a secret:

```
kubectl apply -f secret-tls.yaml
```

The output is similar to:

```
secret/emqx-tls created
```

- Configure EMQX cluster

EMQX CRD supports using `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumes` and `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumeMounts` and `.spec.replicantTemplate.extraVolumes` and `.spec.replicantTemplate.extraVolumeMounts` fields to configure additional volumes and mounts for the EMQX cluster point. In this article, we can use these two fields to configure TLS certificates for the EMQX cluster.

There are many types of Volumes. For the description of Volumes, please refer to the document: [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/). In this article we are using the `secret` type.

           port: 8883
           targetPort: 8883
           nodePort: 32016
```

> `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumes` field configures the volume type as: secret, and the name as: emqx-tls. `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumeMounts` field configures the directory where the TLS certificate is mounted to EMQX: `/mounted/cert`. The `.spec.bootstrapConfig` field configures the certificate path of the TLS listener. For more configurations of the TLS listener, please refer to the document: [ssllistener](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5.0/admin/cfg.html#broker-mqtt-ssl-listener). The `.spec.listenersServiceTemplate` field configures the way the EMQX cluster exposes services to the outside world: NodePort, and specifies the nodePort corresponding to port 8883 of the EMQX ssl-default listener as 32016 (the value range of nodePort is: 30000-32767).

## Verify that the TLS certificate is valid

- Use MQTT X to connect to the EMQX cluster to send messages

MQTT X is a fully open source MQTT 5.0 cross-platform desktop client. Supports quick creation of multiple simultaneous online MQTT client connections, convenient for testing MQTT/TCP, MQTT/TLS, MQTT/WebSocket connection, publishing, subscribing functions and other MQTT protocol features. For more documentation on using MQTT X, please refer to: [MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/docs). Next, we will use MQTT X to connect to the EMQX cluster to send and subscribe messages to verify whether the TLS certificate is valid.

Click the button to create a new connection on the MQTT X page, and configure the EMQX cluster node information and CA certificate path as shown in the figure. After configuring the connection information, click the connect button to connect to the EMQX cluster:

![](./assets/configure-tls/tls-connect.png)

Then click the Subscribe button to create a new subscription, as shown in the figure, MQTT X has successfully connected to the EMQX cluster and successfully created the subscription:

![](./assets/configure-tls/sub.png)

After successfully connecting to the EMQX cluster and creating a subscription, we can send messages to the EMQX cluster, as shown in the following figure:

![](./assets/configure-tls/tls-test.png)

As can be seen from the above figure, if the subscriber can normally receive the MQTT message sent by the client, it means that the TLS we configured is valid.
