# Enable TLS In EMQX

## Task Target

Customize TLS certificates via the `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` fields.

## Create Secret Based On TLS Certificate

Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or keys. For its documentation, please refer to: [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#working-with-secrets). In this article, we use Secret to save TLS certificate information, so we need to create Secret based on TLS certificate before creating EMQX cluster.

+ Save the following as a YAML file and deploy it with the `kubectl apply` command

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: emqx-tls
  type: kubernetes.io/tls
  stringData:
    ca.crt: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    tls.crt: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    tls.key: |
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

  > `ca.crt` indicates the content of the CA certificate, `tls.crt` indicates the content of the server certificate, and `tls.key` indicates the content of the server private key. In this example, the contents of the above three fields are omitted, please fill them with the contents of your own certificate.

## Configure EMQX Cluster

The following is the relevant configuration of EMQX Custom Resource. You can choose the corresponding APIVersion according to the version of EMQX you want to deploy. For the specific compatibility relationship, please refer to [EMQX Operator Compatibility](../index.md):

:::: tabs type:card
::: tab apps.emqx.io/v1beta4

`apps.emqx.io/v1beta4 EmqxEnterprise` supports configuring volumes and mount points for EMQX clusters through `.spec.template.spec.volumes` and `.spec.template.spec.emqxContainer.volumeMounts` fields. In this article, we can use these two fields to configure TLS certificates for the EMQX cluster.

There are many types of Volumes. For the description of Volumes, please refer to the document: [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/). In this article we are using the `secret` type.

+ Save the following as a YAML file and deploy it with the `kubectl apply` command

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v1beta4
  kind: EmqxEnterprise
  metadata:
    name: emqx-ee
  spec:
    template:
      spec:

          image:
            repository: emqx/emqx-ee
            version: 4.4.14
          emqxConfig:
            listener.ssl.external.cacertfile: /mounted/cert/ca.crt
            listener.ssl.external.certfile: /mounted/cert/tls.crt
            listener.ssl.external.keyfile: /mounted/cert/tls.key
            listener.ssl.external: "0.0.0.0:8883"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: emqx-tls
              mountPath: /mounted/cert
        volumes:
          - name: emqx-tls
            secret:
              secretName: emqx-tls
  serviceTemplate:
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
  ```

  > The `.spec.template.spec.volumes` field configures the volume type as: secret, and the name as: emqx-tls.

  > The `.spec.template.spec.emqxContainer.volumeMounts` field configures the directory where the TLS certificate is mounted to EMQX: `/mounted/cert`.

  > The `.spec.template.spec.emqxContainer.emqxConfig` field configures the TLS listener certificate path. For more TLS listener configurations, please refer to the document: [tlsexternal](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/configuration/configuration.html#tlsexternal).

+ Wait for EMQX cluster to be ready, you can check the status of EMQX cluster through the `kubectl get` command, please make sure that `STATUS` is `Running`, this may take some time

  ```bash
  $ kubectl get emqxenterprises
  NAME      STATUS   AGE
  emqx-ee   Running  8m33s
  ```

+ Obtain the External IP of EMQX cluster and access EMQX console

  ```bash
  $ kubectl get svc emqx-ee -o json | jq '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip'

  192.168.1.200
  ```

  Access `http://192.168.1.200:18083` through a browser, and use the default username and password `admin/public` to login EMQX console.

`apps.emqx.io/v2alpha1 EMQX` supports `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumes` and `.spec.coreTemplate.extraVolumeMounts` and `.spec.replicantTemplate.extraVolumes` and `.spec.replicantTemplate.extraVolumeMounts` fields to EMQX The cluster configures additional volumes and mount points. In this article, we can use these two fields to configure TLS certificates for the EMQX cluster.
