EMQX CRD supports using `.spec.dashboardServiceTemplate` to configure EMQX cluster Dashboard Service, using `.spec.listenersServiceTemplate` to configure EMQX cluster listener Service, its documentation can refer to: [Service](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-operator/blob/main-2.1/docs/en_US/reference/v2alpha1-reference.md).

```

> By default, EMQX will open an MQTT TCP listener `tcp-default` corresponding to port 1883 and Dashboard listener `dashboard-listeners-http-bind` corresponding to port 18083. Users can add new listeners through `.spec.bootstrapConfig` field or EMQX Dashboard. EMQX Operator will automatically inject the default listener information into the Service when creating the Service, but when there is a conflict between the Service configured by the user and the listener configured by EMQX (name or port fields are repeated), EMQX Operator will use the user's configuration prevail.

The corresponding CRD of EMQX Enterprise Edition in EMQX Operator is EmqxEnterprise, and EmqxEnterprise supports configuring EMQX cluster Service through `.spec.serviceTemplate` field. For the specific description of the serviceTemplate field, please refer to: [serviceTemplate](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-operator/blob/main-2.1/docs/en_US/reference/v1beta4-reference.md#servicetemplate).

           port: 1883
           targetPort: 1883

The corresponding CRD of EMQX Enterprise Edition in EMQX Operator is EmqxEnterprise, and EmqxEnterprise supports configuration of cluster Service through `.spec.emqxTemplate.serviceTemplate` field. The description of the serviceTemplate field can refer to the document: [serviceTemplate](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-operator/blob/main-2.1/docs/en_US/reference/v1beta3-reference.md#servicetemplate)

Save the above content as: emqx-service.yaml, and execute the following command to deploy the EMQX cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f emqx-service.yaml
```

The output is similar to:

```
emqx.apps.emqx.io/emqx created
```

- Check whether the EMQX cluster is ready

```bash
kubectl get emqx emqx -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select( .type == "Running" and .status == "True")'

## Check whether EMQX Service is ready

- Use the command line to view the EMQX cluster Service

```bash
kubectl get svc -l apps.emqx.io/instance=emqx
```

The output is similar to:

```bash
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                          AGE

```

- Use MQTT X to connect to the EMQX cluster to send messages

Click the button to create a new connection on the MQTT X page, and configure the EMQX cluster node information as shown in the figure. After configuring the connection information, click the connect button to connect to the EMQX cluster:

![](./assets/configure-service/emqx-service-connected.png)

Then click the Subscribe button to create a new subscription, as shown in the figure, MQTT X has successfully connected to the EMQX cluster and successfully created the subscription:

![](./assets/configure-service/sub.png)

After successfully connecting to the EMQX cluster and creating a subscription, we can send messages to the EMQX cluster, as shown in the following figure:

![](./assets/configure-service/emqx-service-pub.png)

- Add new listeners through EMQX Dashboard

Open the browser, enter the host `IP` and port `32012` where the EMQX Pod is located, log in to the EMQX cluster Dashboard (Dashboard default user name: admin, default password: public), enter the Dashboard and click Configuration â†’ Listeners to enter the listener page, We first click the Add Listener button to add a listener named test and port 1884, as shown in the figure below:

![](./assets/configure-service/emqx-add-listener.png)

Then click the Add button to create the listener, as shown in the following figure:

![](./assets/configure-service/emqx-listeners.png)

As can be seen from the figure, the test listener we created has taken effect.

- Check whether the newly added listener is injected into the Service

```bash
kubectl get svc -l apps.emqx.io/instance=emqx
```

The output is similar to:

```bash
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                         AGE
emqx-dashboard   NodePort   10.105.110.235   <none>        18083:32012/TCP                                 13m
emqx-listeners   NodePort   10.106.1.58      <none>        1883:32010/TCP,14567:32011/UDP,1884:30763/TCP   12m
```

From the output results, we can see that the newly added listener 1884 has been injected into the `emqx-listeners` Service.
