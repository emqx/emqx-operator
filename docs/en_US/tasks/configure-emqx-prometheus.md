## Deploy EMQX cluster

EMQX supports exposing indicators through the http interface. For all statistical indicators under the cluster, please refer to the document: [HTTP API](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5.0/observability/prometheus.html)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v2alpha1
kind: EMQX

   name: emqx

   image: emqx/emqx:5.0.14

Save the above content as: emqx.yaml and deploy the EMQX cluster

The output is similar to:

```

```

- Check whether the EMQX cluster is ready

```bash
kubectl get emqx emqx -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select( .type == "Running" and .status == "True")'

## Configure Prometheus Monitor

:::: tabs type:card
::: tab v2alpha1

A PodMonitor Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allows to declaratively define how a dynamic set of services should be monitored. Use label selection to define which services are selected to monitor with the desired configuration, and its documentation can be referred to: [PodMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/design.md#podmonitor)

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
   name: emqx
   namespace: default
   labels:
     app.kubernetes.io/name: emqx
spec:
   jobLabel: emqx-scraping
   namespaceSelector:
     matchNames:
     - default
   podMetricsEndpoints:
   - basicAuth:
       password:
         key: password
         name: emqx-basic-auth
       username:
         key: username
         name: emqx-basic-auth
     interval: 10s
     params:
       type:
       -prometheus
     path: /api/v5/prometheus/stats
     port: http-dashboard
     scheme: http
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       apps.emqx.io/instance: emqx
```

> `path` indicates the path of the indicator collection interface. In EMQX 5, the path is: `/api/v5/prometheus/stats`. `selector.matchLabels` indicates the label of the matching Pod: `apps.emqx.io/instance: emqx`.

Save the above content as: monitor.yaml and execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f monitor.yaml
```

Use basicAuth to provide Monitor with password and account information for accessing EMQX interface

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
   name: emqx-basic-auth
   namespace: default
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
   username: admin
   password: public
```

Save the above content as: secret.yaml and create Secret

```bash
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

## Visit Prometheus to view the indicators of EMQX cluster

Open the Prometheus interface, switch to the Graph page, and enter emqx to display as shown in the following figure:

![](./assets/configure-emqx-prometheus/emqx-prometheus-metrics.png)

Switch to the Status â†’ Targets page, the following figure is displayed, and you can see all monitored EMQX Pod information in the cluster:
