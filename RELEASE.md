## Release Note 🍻

### Features 🌈

- Add `SecurityContext` for `EMQX Custom Resource`
- Add `controller-manager-metrics-service` and the `kube-rabc-proxy` which can be used to protect the `/metrics` endpoint by putting it behind auth if you want EMQX Operator Controller to expose the `/metrics` to Prometheus
